# Project: Bare Metal Forms and Helpers

This is part of the Forms Project in The Odin Projectâ€™s Ruby on Rails Curriculum. Find it at http://www.theodinproject.com

### Notes

1. Replaced a soft-deprecated `form_for` with `form_with`
2. All forms generated by `form_with` will be submitted by an XHR (Ajax) request by default. To disable remote forms set `local` to `true`: 
```ruby
<%= form_with model: @user, local: true do |f| %>
```
3. The error messages are displayed next to the attribute of the failed model object and not as a list at the top of the page.
